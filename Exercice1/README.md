### Class Name:
**`FileManagement`**

---


### Purpose:
The `FileManagement` class facilitates the loading and management of file metadata from a specified directory. It retrieves and stores details such as file paths, file types (directory or file), and permissions (read, write, hidden) for each file in the directory.

---

### Attributes:
- **`folderFiles`** (`List<Map<String, Object>>`):  
  A private, final list that stores metadata about files and directories in the form of maps. Each map represents a single file or directory with keys for path, type, and permissions.

---

### Methods:

#### 1. **`getFiles()`**
- **Return Type**: `List<Map<String, Object>>`
- **Description**:  
  Returns the `folderFiles` list, which contains metadata of all loaded files and directories.

---

#### 2. **`loadFolderContent(File folder)`**
- **Parameters**:
    - `folder` (`File`): The folder from which file metadata is to be loaded.
- **Description**:  
  Checks if the given folder exists and is a directory. If valid, it retrieves all files and directories inside it, gathers their metadata, and stores the data in the `folderFiles` list. Each file or directory's metadata includes:
    - **`path`**: Absolute file path.
    - **`type`**: Indicates if it is a directory (`<DIR>`) or a regular file (`<FICH>`).
    - **`permissions`**: Permissions string generated by the `loadPermissions` method.
- **Error Handling**:  
  Prints an error message if the folder does not exist or is not a directory.

---

#### 3. **`loadPermissions(File file)`** *(private method)*
- **Parameters**:
    - `file` (`File`): The file or directory for which permissions are to be determined.
- **Return Type**: `String`
- **Description**:  
  Generates a string representation of the file's permissions:
    - **`r`**: Readable.
    - **`w`**: Writable.
    - **`h`**: Hidden.  
      If a permission is not available, a dash (`-`) is used.

---


### Key Points:
- Supports basic file management by gathering metadata.
- Outputs file types and permissions in a readable format.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully with error messages.


### Class Name:
**`Main`**

---

### Purpose:
The `Main` class prompts the user to enter the path of a folder, uses the `FileManagement` class to load metadata about the folder's contents, and prints the details of each file and directory to the console.

---

### Workflow:
1. **User Input**:
    - The program uses a `Scanner` to prompt the user for the path to a folder. The path is then read as a string.

2. **Folder Initialization**:
    - A `File` object is created using the provided path.

3. **File Management**:
    - An instance of the `FileManagement` class is created.
    - The `loadFolderContent()` method is invoked on this instance, passing the `File` object as an argument.

4. **Output Display**:
    - The `getFiles()` method retrieves the list of file metadata from the `FileManagement` instance.
    - A `forEach` loop iterates through this list, printing the metadata of each file or directory. Specifically, the output includes:
        - **File Path** (`path`).
        - **File Type** (`type`).
        - **File Permissions** (`permissions`).

---

### Example Usage:

#### Input:
```plaintext
Enter the path of the folder:
C:/example
```

#### Folder Structure (Example):
```
C:/example/
    file1.txt
    folder1/
    hiddenFile.log (hidden)
```

#### Output:
```plaintext
C:\example\file1.txt <FICH> rw-
C:\example\folder1 <DIR> rw-
C:\example\hiddenFile.log <FICH> rwh
```

---

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Input**:
    - The user is prompted to provide the folder path dynamically.
2. **File Metadata**:
    - Displays a detailed summary of each file and directory.
3. **Readability**:
    - Output includes path, type, and permissions in an easy-to-read format.
4. **Error Handling**:
    - If the folder does not exist or is not a directory, the `FileManagement` class gracefully handles it by displaying an error message.

---

### Notes:
- The program closes the `Scanner` after reading input to prevent resource leaks.
- It assumes the folder path provided by the user is accessible and readable by the program.
- To enhance usability, consider adding input validation and additional error messages for invalid paths.
